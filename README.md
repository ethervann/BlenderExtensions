To install these to your Blender extensions folder you must download and unzip the extensions you would like to use.

Then, you must locate the extensions folder for your Blender version and move the files there. In my case I am using 4.5 as of the day that I'm writing this, which means my extensions folder is found here:
..\Users\[YourUser]\AppData\Roaming\Blender Foundation\Blender\4.5\extensions


Double check that your Blender has that same directory in the custom directory field of the User Default repository's advanced settings.
You can find that setting at Edit > Preferences > Get Extensions > Repositories > User Default > Advanced.

Finally, go to the add-ons tab in the Edit > Preferences menu and tick the boxes next to all of the extensions you've just installed. 
If they aren't there you may need to Refresh Local which you can do from the dropdown arrow at the top right corner of the Preferences window.


I'll list where the extensions should show up:

Evan's Export Tool -> Output tab.
Evan's Batch Export Tool -> Output tab.


Hopefully, they are in their right place. Thanks for checking my stuff out!
